# Fuzzing
Fuzzing involves sending malformed data into application input and watching for unexpected crashes.

# Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
DEP is a set of hardware, and software, technologies that perform additional checks on memory, to help prevent malicious code from running on a system. The primary benefit of DEP is to help prevent code execution from data pages, by raising an exception, when execution occurs.

# Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
ASLR randomizes the base addresses of loaded applications, and DLLs, every time the Operating System is booted.
