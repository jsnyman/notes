#### Ollydbg

+ Top left : Program instructions in executable file
+ Top right : CPU registers and their flags
+ Bottom right: The stack memory of this program
+ Bottom left: Memory dump of a region in memory

**Shortcuts**
  * F7 - step into
  * F8 - step over


+ When stepping into a function, the current function is suspended, and the return address (the next instruction to be executed when returning) is written on the stack.
